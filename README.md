# Basic react exam project

This project was made by me - D. Dobrev.

It contains a few dynamic pages including details page, menu page, edit page, etc. It also contains user authentication and account creation and more.
A server is required to be started in order for the app to run properly. The server is located inside a "server" folder in the main project folder.

## How to run the app

- Run a terminal inside the project folder and type 'npm start'
- Run a terminal inside the project folder and type 'cd server' followed by 'node server'
